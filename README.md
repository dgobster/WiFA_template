### Final Proposal
Persona/Scenario:
The persona should include a description of a prototypical, target user and includes discussion of their interests and responsibilities (e.g., their job description if a professional/scientist; their motivation if part of the general public), with a specific focus on their key needs, expertise levels (across domains and technologies), and motivation. Your description of needs should connect directly to lecture discussion of goals, objectives, operands, and insights: in other words, describe their overarching goals, their primary tasks (objectives+operands), and key insights. You do not need to support all potential goals/tasks/insights, but make clear in your discussion which you believe you need to emphasize in your conceptual design. The scenario then walks us through a hypothetical interaction session with your proposed interactive map, working through multiple stages of interaction loops. As you describe your scenario, relate the proposed functionality (representation designs and interaction operators) to user objectives using terminology from lecture. Your persona and scenario combined are limited to 500 words in the draft (although may grow beyond this in the final submission given discussion).

Persona-1: Sahar is a social worker working with individuals and families who do not have sufficient resources to meet their basic needs. One of her goals is to help them find appropriate food sources near their homes. Some of Sahar’s clients currently have access to FoodShare and/or WIC, while others are applying or are ineligible but still unable to afford food. 
User Case Scenario-1: Upon arriving at the interactive, she is asked to choose which type of user she is (someone looking for food assistance for themself or others, someone providing food assistance, or someone with excess food to donate). From there, she is asked to choose appropriate filters for the services she is seeking. Sahar wants to identify food banks, pantries, and community fridges within walking or bussing distance of her clients’ places of residence. Some of her clients have restricted diets, so she hopes to compare what types of foods are offered at various pantries, filtering for gluten-free, dairy-free, and other allergen-free food availability where possible. She is drawn to the distinctive icons that assist her in identifying where these food access needs can be met. Next, she wants to identify which grocery stores and convenience stores near their places of residence take FoodShare/EBT and/or WIC. Because some of her clients use both EBT and WIC, she wants to be able to filter for both of them at once. For her immunocompromised clients, she also hopes to identify which pantries will deliver food to her clients’ homes and which stores will allow her clients to use EBT for in-store pickup. Though she knows this is possible at Woodman’s, she is unsure what other stores provide this service. Sahar uses the available affordances to filter and compare available food for her clients, ranking which nearby locations are most likely to meet their needs.

Persona-2: Matt is a farmer in Dane County, managing 10 acres of land for vegetable production right outside of the City of Madison. Matt’s is very involved in his community and works with a local nonprofit to organize a gleaning program where he and a handful of other farmers in the area host volunteers to glean the excess produce they don’t have a market for, for donation to area food pantries. Matt has been looking for support connecting with pantries in need of donations, as well as expanding his gleaning volunteer & volunteer network.

User Case Scenario-2: Upon arriving at the interactive, Matt selects his user type and is prompted to filter for the services he is looking to connect with. Matt recently had an order canceled for 500 lbs of tomatoes that were already harvested and he is looking to identify food pantries in his area that can take his donation so he can get a tax deduction for the produce he can’t sell. Matt checks the provider type box for the food banks & pantries overlay and filters the geographic extent to Dane County. The new map view generates an insight of a pattern of community fridges in downtown Madison a short drive from his farm. However, through retrieving their organization information Matt realizes that although they are nearby him and one another, allowing for easy drop off, they are in fact all singular community fridges and even combined unlikely to properly store his produce. Matt then filters the accessibility services to those with transport, and is able to compare the services of Second Harvest Foodbank of Southern Wisconsin to the community fridges. While Second Harvest is further from his farm, the food banks have a larger storage capacity and can pick up the tomatoes, achieving his goal of efficient distribution. Finally, Matt retrieves their contact information and calls them to arrange a pick up.

Persona-3: Janet is the Chief Strategy and Development Officer at Second Harvest Food Bank of Southern Wisconsin. Her goal is to bring food and meet the nutritional needs of communities facing hunger. Each year, Janet revises their strategies to acquire and store nutritious food from a variety of sources including local and regional farmers, food manufacturers, and grocers which also helps to reduce food waste. Second Harvest distributes millions of pounds of food throughout 16 southwestern Wisconsin counties every year through collaboration with other agencies and programs such as FoodShare Outreach.

User Case Scenario-3: Upon arriving at the interactive, Janet needs to select which type of user she is and what type of services she is seeking. She can filter food providers and the types of food they provide in the southwestern Wisconsin counties to engage in a collaboration with them. She can also identify the local food distributors, their storage capacity and if they support services like FoodShare, EBT, WIC or direct delivery to the clients. Then she can compare their locations to the nearest food providers’ location to build up a stronger and efficient network. She can also compare and rank the areas with stronger supply and demand gap and plan to re-distribute manpower or find more volunteers to assist distribution in those areas. Thus, she can develop insights using the interactive in order to achieve her goal to update their yearly strategy and co-design food distribution methods to provide equitable distribution of food in all areas of southwestern Wisconsin.
*Target users: Folks looking for food assistance; folks working to provide food assistance; people who have excess food to donate (food providers/producers)
