                <li>The purpose of this map is to help you find resources.</p> 
                    
                    <p>Whether you are an <b>individual</b> who needs to find food for yourself, your family, or a friend; an <b>individual, group, or company</b> that would like to donate food; or <b>part of an organization</b> that would like to work with other organizations to distribute food; this map is for you.</p> 
                    
                    <p>To use this map, open the <b>"Services"</b> and <b>"Providers"</b> tabs by clicking on them. Click on the box(es) that best represent what you are looking for.</p>
                
                    <p>For example, if you are looking for a store or farmer's market that accepts <b>SNAP</b> (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program - also known as <b>"EBT," "FoodShare," or "Food Stamps"</b>),</b> click on the box next to the "Accepts SNAP" service.</p>

                    <p>If you are looking for a store that accepts <b>WIC</b> (a supplemental nutrition program for Women, Infants, and Children), click on the box next to the "Accepts WIC" service.</p> 
                        
                    <p>If you are looking for a food bank or pantry, click on the box next to the "Food Bank/Pantry" service.</p>

                    <p>Once you <b>click</b> on the box(es) of your choice, organizations that meet the requirements of your choices will show up as <b>a dot/dots</b> on the map. </p>

                    <p>Then, when you click on a dot, more information will be available in the box in the <b>"location information"</b> section in the upper righthand side corner of the map. </p>

                    <p>This box will provide <b>as much information as we have</b> about that organization. This may include their mission statement, their phone number, their address, their website, and/or other important information.</p>

                    <p>The <b>legend</b> in the lower right-hand area of the map indicates which type of service is provided.</p>

                    <p>To navigate the map, you have many options. You can use your <b>mouse</b> or <b>touchpad</b> if you wish. </p>

                    <p>However, you can also use the <b>zoom controls</b>. These controls are at the upper-lefthand side of the map and consist of a "+" and a "-" button. The + button zooms in closer, and the - button zooms out. </p>

                    <p>If you want the map to go back to the way it was before you zoomed in or out, you may click on the <b>"Reset Zoom"</b> button underneath these controls. </p>

                    <p>If you want to move the map up, down, or to the left or right without zooming, you can use the "pan" buttons. These buttons have <b>arrows</b> pointing in the direction the map will move if you click on them. </p>

                    <p>The "Reset Zoom" button will also reset the map <b>after</b> you have panned in another direction.</p>
